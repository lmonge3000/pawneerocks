				<p>Leslie Knope was born and raised in Indiana. From infancy, she held high aspirations to serve her country in politics.  Even as a kindergartener, Knope made mock campaign advertisements for fun.  With an undying sense of optimism, she is a relentless "go-getter." If Leslie sets her mind on an accomplishment you can bet it will be achieved.  One of her early crowning accomplishments as the Deputy director of the Pawnee Parks Department was building her own park on lot 48.</p>
